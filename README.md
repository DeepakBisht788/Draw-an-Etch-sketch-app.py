# Interactive Turtle Drawing
This program uses Python's **turtle** module to create an interactive environment where you can control the turtle using keyboard inputs. The turtle responds to movement and rotation commands to draw on the screen.

## Features
- Move the turtle forward and backward.
- Rotate the turtle left or right.
- Clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.

## Controls
- **W**: Move the turtle forward by 100 units.
- **S**: Move the turtle backward by 100 units.
- **A**: Rotate the turtle counterclockwise by 10 degrees.
- **D**: Rotate the turtle clockwise by 10 degrees.
- **C**: Clear the screen and reset the turtle to the center.

## How It Works
1. The program listens for keyboard inputs.
2. When you press the keys, the turtle performs the corresponding action:
   - Move forward (W), move backward (S).
   - Rotate counterclockwise (A) or clockwise (D).
   - Clear the screen and reset the turtle (C).
3. The screen updates with each action, showing the turtle's movement and drawing.
